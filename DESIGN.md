Prompt:

Ok so what we wanted to design a new package to replace later. We want to create a new package that is easy to use.

I want to make it so the user can just create an interval using set_interval and if there are still tasks to be executed then the process is kept alive even if using Rscript. Also this should not block the main thread. How can we accomplish this? Maybe use a fork/new thread/future/background process to run this interval?

We should not block the main thread the main synchronous code in a user's script and it should work running with Rscript.

In short I want us to bring the functionality of JavaScript's setInterval, clearInterval, setTimeout to R.

To keep the process running when a user runs the code with `Rscript` in non-interactive mode, we need to start a background thread or process that runs the event loop. This background thread or process will keep running until all scheduled tasks have been executed or until the user manually stops it.

Here's an updated design document that includes more details on how we can implement this:

### R Functions and Classes

1.  **QueueR6** (R6 Class)
    *   This class will be an R6 wrapper around the C++ `EventLoop` class.
    *   Methods:
        *   `new()`: Constructor that initializes the C++ `EventLoop` object.
        *   `set_interval(expr, interval)`: Calls the C++ `set_interval` function to schedule a recurring task.
        *   `clear_interval(id)`: Calls the C++ `clear_interval` function to remove a recurring task.
        *   `set_timeout(expr, timeout)`: Calls the C++ `set_timeout` function to schedule a one-time task.
        *   `run()`: Starts the event loop in a background thread or process.

### C++ Classes and Functions

1.  **Task** (C++ Class)
    
    *   This class represents a task that is scheduled to be executed.
    *   Members:
        *   `func`: A `std::function` object that represents the task to be executed.
        *   `time`: A `std::chrono::steady_clock::time_point` object that represents the scheduled time of the task.
    *   Methods:
        *   Constructor that initializes the `func` and `time` members.
2.  **EventLoop** (C++ Class)
    
    *   This class represents the event loop that runs in the background and executes tasks.
    *   Members:
        *   `task_queue`: A `std::priority_queue` that stores the scheduled tasks.
    *   Methods:
        *   `add_task(const Task&)`: Adds a task to the `task_queue`.
        *   `run()`: The main loop that checks the `task_queue` for tasks that are ready to be executed and executes them.
3.  **set_interval** (C++ Function)
    
    *   This function schedules a recurring task.
    *   Parameters:
        *   `func`: A `std::function` object that represents the task to be executed.
        *   `interval`: An `int` that represents the interval between task executions in milliseconds.
    *   Returns:
        *   An `int` that represents the ID of the scheduled task.
4.  **clear_interval** (C++ Function)
    
    *   This function removes a recurring task.
    *   Parameters:
        *   `id`: An `int` that represents the ID of the task to be removed.
5.  **set_timeout** (C++ Function)
    
    *   This function schedules a one-time task.
    *   Parameters:
        *   `func`: A `std::function` object that represents the task to be executed.
        *   `timeout`: An `int` that represents the time until the task is executed in milliseconds.

### Rcpp Interface

*   We will use the `Rcpp` package to interface the C++ code with R.
*   The `Rcpp` functions will wrap the C++ functions and classes and expose them to R as R functions and classes.

### Keeping the Process Alive in Rscript

*   To keep the process alive when running the code with `Rscript`, we will need to start the C++ `EventLoop` in a separate thread or process.
*   The main thread will then wait for the background thread to finish before exiting.
*   This can be achieved using the `std::thread` class in C++ to run the event loop in a background thread.
*   The `QueueR6` class will have a `run` method that starts the event loop in a background thread or process.
*   The user will need to call this `run` method after scheduling tasks to keep the process alive.
*   The background thread or process will keep running until all scheduled tasks have been executed or until the user manually stops it.
*   This approach will not block the main thread, allowing synchronous code in the user's script to run immediately.

We have implemented the `Task` and `EventLoop` classes in C++. Now, we need to implement the following:

1.  **C++ Functions:**
    
    *   `set_interval`: This function will schedule a recurring task.
    *   `clear_interval`: This function will remove a recurring task.
    *   `set_timeout`: This function will schedule a one-time task.
2.  **Rcpp Interface:**
    
    *   We need to use the `Rcpp` package to interface the C++ code with R. This will involve wrapping the C++ classes and functions and exposing them to R as R functions and classes.
3.  **R6 Classes in R:**
    
    *   `QueueR6`: This R6 class will be an R wrapper around the C++ `EventLoop` class. It will have methods for `set_interval`, `clear_interval`, `set_timeout`, and `run`.
4.  **Testing:**
    
    *   We need to test the package to make sure everything is working as expected.
5.  **Documentation:**
    
    *   We need to write documentation for the package, including how to install and use it, and descriptions of the functions and classes.

Once these steps are completed, we will have a fully functioning R package that provides asynchronous behavior similar to JavaScript's `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, and `setTimeout` functions.
